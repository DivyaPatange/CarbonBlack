		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;Measurement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Over the course of human history, first for convenience and then for necessity, standards of measurement evolved so that communities would have certain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;common benchmarks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;and a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; consistent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;understanding of quantities. Laws regulating measurement were originally developed to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;prevent fraud &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;in commerce.  Therefore,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; they had to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;easy to use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;and interpret.  At first, t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;hese standards were achieved by local agreements &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;between trading partners or collaborators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;widely accepted standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; of that progression was due to multinational companies that needed standards in their measurements for consistent trade.  Therefore, separate systems originated in countries such as England – that is the Imperial system who had colonies all over the world.  Finally, there was recognition that a global standard was necessary for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;consistency between countries, traders and scientists.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;hat resulted in the modern &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;International System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; of Units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; (SI) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;being developed.   Remnants of the older systems still exist to complicate things, but most modern countries now use this international standard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

There are 1000 grams in a kilogram.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Many of our day to day food products and our body weight is expressed in kilograms.  The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;unit of length is the meter.  There are 1000 meters in a kilometer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The height of an individual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; is usually expressed in meters and the speed of a car is commonly expressed in kilometers per hour.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Many monetary systems in the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;are based on a system of ten also.  For instance, the Indian system is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;based on the rupee with one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;paisa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;being a decimal part of a rupee – one hundredth of a rupee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Monetary systems are unique for each country and are not standardized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; between countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Therefore, comparisons are much more difficult.  The values they express vary depending on many circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;  They are not part of the SI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; uniform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; system allows us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; to communicate in a standard language of measurement so we can understand the relationships between measurements, understand baselines and compare progress.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;It &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;is much the same when we converse in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Hindi as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;a common language because we all do not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;all converse in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; Bengali&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In this course, we will encounter a variety of measurements that are required for us to understand the carbon black process and the science related to this process.

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;As part of an international company, our standard unit of measurement in Himadri is the SI system.  Because we are in an International commerce system, conversions to U.S., Imperial,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; or other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;units of measurement or other systems may be required on an infrequent basis.  We will not concentrate on these type conversions because they will not be common in our everyday practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In this course, we will encounter a variety of measurements that are required for us to understand the carbon black process and the science related to this process.   To be consistent, we will use the SI system of measurement.  The purpose of the SI system of measurement is to reduce all Base quantities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; to combinations of seven properties as follows:  Time, Length, Mass, Electric Current, Temperature, Amount of Substance, and Luminous Intensity.  We will briefly cover each of these properties in this overview and some of the applications we will experience in our work environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Time, is a subject that is very familiar to us all, though not very consistent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; in the common units used.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Time in our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; SI system is expressed in standard units of seconds, although many standard time frames are used including minutes which are 60 seconds and hours which are 60 minutes or 3600 seconds.  Then there is one earth rotation equivalent to a day of 24 hours.  Then we get into the time required for the earth to travel one complete orbit around the sun which is called a years.  This irregular system has evolved over the centuries and is still in use as the common method of expressing time used in the world.  Perhaps some day, we will change the system to a system based on the number 10 but, except in expressing very short measurements, such as milliseconds or microseconds, this is not common today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The most commonly used units of time are as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; follows where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;	60 seconds = 1 minute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;	60 minutes = 1 hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;	24 hours = 1 day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Some non-systematic uses of time are as follows:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;10 years = 1 decade; 100 years = 1 century; 1000 years = 1 millennium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Time is commonly used to help express a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;rate of progression such as the production of carbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; black in kilograms &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;per day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, use of oil in kilograms of oil &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;per hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, and air speeds in meters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;per second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  We are interested in benchmarking many phenomena in our plant in elapsed time periods so we can set standards and improve.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

The centimeter which is one one-hundredth of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;meter is about the thickness of my small finger but think how different&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; measurements would be if everyone used his small  finger to measure the length of something, such as a pipeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Since&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; length is about visible dimensions, the human eye has a range of vision from objects that are small insects to the size of a whale and beyond.  A carbon black pellet agglomerate may be 2 to 3 millimeters in length (or diameter).  To see smaller dimensions, a light microscope can be  used to measure the size of objects down to micrometers in length.  With carbon black particles we need an electron microscope to measure objects that are as small as 10 nanometers – or ten billionths of a meter - in size.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Mass and weight are similar but sometimes difficult terms to understand “scientifically” because the weight of an object depends upon an acceleration such as gravity.  Gravity is a variable force depending on where you are on the earth or in the universe.  For instance, the moon, the weight of a person will be only about 17% of that on earth.  Mass of an object is independent of gravity or other forces.  We won’t get into any more details about these differences here but you do need to understand this basic concept.  In most measurements, we are interested in the weight expressed in kilograms.  In some engineering calculations we may have to adjust the “weight” expressed in kilograms due to minor gravity influences but these are not common conversions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In the SI unit system, the standard unit for weight is the kilogram.  There are 1000 grams in a kilogram.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Usually if someone is measuring the weight of a relatively large mass such as a person, in the SI system he uses kilograms for that measurement. Weight of  vegetables in countries where the SI system is used are typically in kilograms sometimes referred to “kilos” or grams.   If we measure larger weights in the SI system, we use metric tons.  A metric ton is 1000 kilograms of weight.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Feedstock oil for our plant is commonly measured in weights such as kilograms or metric tons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Also, our inventories of carbon blacks may be expressed in kilograms or tons of product.  Many of our raw materials will be measured in weights so we precisely know how much we have used or how much we have in our inventories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;The movement of an electric charge is known as an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;electric current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, the intensity of which is usually measured in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;amperes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some substances called electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electric insulator.  A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; lightening storm is a good physical representation of electric current flowing in the atmosphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The electric potential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; difference &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; volt &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;is the unit used to describe this electric potential difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;  T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;his term sees greater everyday usage such as the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; voltage in a battery used for electronics or car ignition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  If we measure the potential between the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; “plus” and “minus” poles of a battery with a voltmeter, we can discover the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;voltage potential &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;of the battery.  If we measure the flow of electrons, we can discover the current or amperage of the circuit using the battery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;A Watt is one unit of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;electrical power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; equal to one ampere under the “pressure” of one volt.  This is the common means to measure the power consumed by our electrical circuits, such as lights,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; electrical heaters and motors and is also the power generated by our electrical generators.  Steam generated from tail gas is converted to electrical power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The power unit of a watt is typically used for small appliances such as a light bulb or a microwave oven.  For large motors and generators, the power is expressed as in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;kilowatts &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;of power, which is 1000 watts.  For the generating power of our electrical generators, the power may be expressed in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;megawatts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; of power, which is 1000 kilowatts.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In the plant, we are interested in the amount of energy consumed by our electrical circuits which include lighting circuits, motors and electrical heaters.  We typically want to know the power required to do some specific work such as moving a gas or liquid through a pipeline so we can understand the energy expended and the cost for that service.  To determine the energy consumed, we use a energy term called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;the watt-hour &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;or the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;kilowatt-hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; which takes the power consumption in watts and projects that usage over a fixed period of time in hours.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Electricity is a complex and interesting science.  Our brief discussion here only touches on the basics of this field and the way it is measured. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

The Centigrade scale is based on a range of temperature that considers water is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;frozen at zero degrees Celsius &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;and boils at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;100 degrees Celsius &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;under normal atmospheric pressure.  There are subtle differences between the terms Centigrade temperatures and Celsius temperatures &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; for practical purposes the terms can be used interchangeably.  Both the Celsius and Centigrade scales are based on the metric system with a base of 10.  For everyday uses, we will use the Centigrade scale which fits the temperature ranges we will deal with in the plant.  For some more complicated engineering calculations, particularly for gases, we will need to use the Kelvin scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In the plant, we use many types of temperature measurements to set our process conditions so we can optimize production, yields and heat transfer.  We experience temperatures higher than 2000 degrees Celsius in the combustors used on some of our reactors.  The operating temperatures of our reactors range between approximately 1300 degrees Celsius and 1700 degrees Celsius depending on our carbon black product requirements. Hot air preheat for the combustors are in the range of 750 degrees Celsius.  Our bag filters are operated under 300 degrees Celsius so not to exceed the bag cloth temperatures.  Carbon black temperatures in the dryer are approximately 180 degrees Celsius in order to keep the temperature over the evaporation point of water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;You will find many temperature measurements in our carbon black process and we will review the uses and requirements as we progress through the various modules in this course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

We will not get into the actual number and what that means. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;Avogadro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold" textDecoration="underline"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;is worth further investigation if you are interested.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;We briefly touched on an example of the use of a mole in our Introduction to Carbon Black Chemistry.  This measurement is derived from the fact that naturally occurring &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;substances combine in certain fixed ratios &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;to form more complex substances.  The atomic or molecular weight of those substances are used to determine the fixed quantity of each element that defines the combination.   We can get the molecular and atomic weights from chemical tables or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;the Periodic table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; which gives an outline of the properties of all the substances found on the Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;mole is defined &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;by International Bureau of Weights and Measures as &amp;quot;the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;0.012 kilogram of carbon-12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Isn’t it interesting that we produce a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; type of pure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; carbon product on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; which this IS standard is based.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;One of the common molecules that we are familiar in everyday life is water, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;H-two-O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Do you remember &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;the table &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;we used to show the combinations and resulting amounts.  When water is formed, two atoms of hydrogen with a relative weight of 1 combine with one atom of oxygen with a relative weight of 16 to form a molecule of water with a relative weight of 18.  Since hydrogen is commonly a gas with two hydrogen atoms and oxygen is a gas with two oxygen atoms, the combinations of these gases are required in a ratio of two hydrogen molecules with one molecule of oxygen to make water.  At the completion of the reaction, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;two molecules of water are formed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Since we have a chemical process where complicated combustion reactions are taking place, we will use this substance background to determine the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;yield of carbon black &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;from our reactors by analyzing the ‘moles” of raw materials input to the reactor, the reaction combinations, and the analysis of the resulting gases from the process.  We can also do other chemical calculations to determine the efficiency of various reactions that we will observe in this course.  It’s not that complicated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;This is a standard that has reference to how we measure the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;intensity of light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  This is the one subject that we will spend very little time exploring since it has little to do with the physical manufacturing of carbon black – The exception is that we will want to have enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; visible light to see how to operate the plant and read the various meters safely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Like other SI base units, the intensity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; of light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; is defined by the description of a physical process that will produce &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;one candela &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;of luminous intensity.  You can infer by the name of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; the unit “candela” that the property was developed by relating the light produced to the illumination of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;a candle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  As science progressed, we needed a more scientific definition that was not affected by the size of the candle, the wick, the wax type, etc.  So, by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; definition, if one constructs a light source that emits monochromatic green light with a frequency of 540 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;TeraHertz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, and that has a radiant intensity of 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; divided by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;683 watts per &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;ste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;-radian in a given direction, that light source will emit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;one candela &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;in the specified direction.   Above is a diagram that reflects the various terms that are used to measure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; some of the properties of light illumination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;You can see from this definition of this standard unit, that much scientific thought has been used to develop each one of these concepts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

As we introduced this module, we presented the seven basic units of measurements of the SI system.  From these seven base quantities many other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;derived quantity units &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;can be formed.  We are going to discuss several of these derived units which are listed in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. These will be measurements that you will need to only understand in general to have a basic understanding about the measurements used in our plant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The measurement of volume uses the unit of length cubed.  So the units of measurement is the cubic meter or if the size of the quantity is smaller, the cubic centimeter.   The measurement of pressure uses a term called a Pascal.  A Pascal is a force of one Newton pressing on one square meter – in SI units that is one kg per meter per second squared.  Heat energy is measured in Joules.  One Joule is 1 kilogram per square meter per second squared.  Mass flow rate and volumetric flow rate are kilogram per second and cubic meter per second respectively.  Usually, we use hourly flow rates so we convert the seconds of flow to hours.  We will also discuss carbon black production rates which are derived from the mass flow rates of carbon black.  We will also discuss carbon black yields which are derived from the mass flow rates of carbon black and the feedstock and fuels used to produce that amount of carbon black.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;As you can see, we are finished with any derived unit measurements concerning electric current, temperature, amount of substance and luminous intensity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;, the cubic meter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;or when the quantities are small, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;cubic centimeters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In the SI system, one common unit of measurement of volumes of liquids is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;liter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; which can be found in shops for bottled water, soft drinks and myriad other products.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; A liter is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;1000 cubic centimeters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;in volume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The volume of a fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; mass of liquid may &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;change due to temperature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  You can see the volume of water expand when heated for making tea or coffee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;  Therefore,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; a reference to a liquid’s temperature should be noted when measuring a certain volume of that liquid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;Gas volumes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;are also usually&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; measured in cubic meters.  However, gas volumes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;change due to both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;pressures and temperatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  For ideal or perfect gases, the gas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; volumes change.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In order to define a gas volume perfectly, the temperature and pressure of that gas must be measured as well.  A standard cubic meter reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;d to a volume at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;zero degrees Celsius and a pressure of 1.0135 bar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;is called a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;NORMAL &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;ubic meter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;  For a gas at Normal temperature and pressure, 22.4 liters of the gas constitutes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;one molar volume &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;of the gas.  This is a convenient conversion factor to determine the mass of the gas for reaction calculations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

It is expressed as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;force per unit area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  One common example of pressure is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;the pressure cooker &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;where the contents of a pot are heated until the pressure of the steam inside the pot rises and elevates the temperature to a point that the contents are cooked quickly.  Also, the LPG used for cooking is under pressure in a bottle.  We can use the pressure of the LPG to give an indication of the contents remaining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The force of one Newton pressing on an area of one square meter is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;one Pascal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, a derived SI unit we discussed earlier.  In the plant we use pressure gauges that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;measure in bars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, a non- SI unit which is defined as 100,000 Pascal or 100,000 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Newtons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; per square meter or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;kilogram per square centimeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  One atmosphere pressure or 1 kilogram force per square centimeter is 98.0665 kilo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Pascals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  One bar is approximately 1 atmosphere of pressure at sea level, actually 0.987 atmospheric pressure at sea level. P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;ressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; is often specified in multiples of atmospheric &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Since most pressure measurements are made open to the earth’s atmospheric pressure system, we normally call these measurements &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;“gauge” pressures &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;because the baseline pressure, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;zero, is the atmospheric pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;“Absolute” pressure &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;is based on a reference point of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;complete vacuum which is zero pressure &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;in this reference state. Normally, we need to consider only gauge pressure for our most basic measurements in our process and most of our “pressure gauges” measure at this pressure.  Sometimes a “g” is added is added to the pressure reading to clarify that this is gauge pressure not absolute pressure.  A vacuum is normally measured as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;negative gauge pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  If during the course of a comparison it is required to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;change gauge pressure to absolute pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, you must add the atmospheric pressure in the same units to the gauge pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In the plant we will use many gauge pressures.  As we stated earlier, the pressure and temperature of a gas are required in order to define the mass of the gas we have available, so in all cases where we measure gases, a pressure is required.  We may use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;pressure gauges &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;to measure baseline pressures but in many cases we use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;pressure transmitters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;to measure the pressures so we can see trends in the control room.  We also use pressures to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;measure the differential pressures across &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;orifices to measure flow and for determining the height of a fluid in a tank.  We will measure pressures of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;oil and water sprays &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;so we can monitor the effective atomization, that is droplet size, of that operation.  We measure &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;small pressures or negative pressures called vacuums &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;using manometers and these pressures may be in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;millibars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; or millimeters of water or mercury.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Pressure measurement is one of the fundamental measurements for plant operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

It is important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; that we know the flow rates so we can determine the consumption of each of these substances compared to the carbon black that is produced and for determining the total costs of operation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Liquids are typically measured with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;mass flow meters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Then it is simple to express these flow rates in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;mass per unit time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Determining efficiencies are much simpler when the values are expressed as mass units rather than volume units.  This allows all the comparisons to be made in similar units of measurement when making chemical reaction comparisons and determining efficiencies of the process.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;If&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; volumetric flow rates are used, then any flow calculations requiring mass flow rates will have to be converted to mass using the density of the fluid being transported.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

If the constant temperature and pressure are not expressed, the relationship of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;mass of gas being used is uncertain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;and mass rates are important in understanding how efficient our chemical processes work.  Therefore, for measurement of gases a reference temperature and pressure is usually expressed by the term “Normal” in the SI system. The gas flow rates will be expressed in Normal Cubic Meters per hour.  In this system of measurement the constant &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;temperature used is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; always&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; 0 degrees Celsius, or plus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; 273 degrees Kelvin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; and the standard pressure is 1.01325  bar absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Some of our measurement systems convert the flow measurement in volume per unit time directly to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;Normal pressure and temperature,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;that is to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;Normal cubic meters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;so&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; the meter reading is actually in Normal measurement units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The volume of 1 mole of any gas is called its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;molar volume and is equal to 22.4 Liters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;at standard temperature and pressure. Molar volume allows conversions to be made between moles and volumes of gases at standard temperature and pressure.  This is a very useful quantity that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; can be used to calculate molar mass when gases are measured at standard temperatures and pressures and for chemical reaction mass balances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

This is one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;calculation that is not consistent in the carbon black industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;For another&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; type analysis the total carbon black produced can be compared to the feedstock carbon in the feedstock and fuel to get a carbon yield percentage which also is a good indicator of the total process efficiency.  This is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;‘carbon efficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;”.  Since carbon production is our business, the amount of total carbon we recover from the hydrocarbons is what we finally want to baseline as our efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In the SI system of measurement, the throughputs of our carbon black production units and plants are normally expressed in kilograms per hour, metric tons per day or metric tons per year.  The amount of carbon we produce is assessed and balanced using our standard yields and throughputs then balanced with the inventories we experience as we package the final product.  This gives us a good indication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; of the amount of carbon produced for each product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;As an example, if we use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;8000 kilograms of feedstock and fuel &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;and produce a product that has a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;yield estimate of 1.6 kilogram of feedstock and fuel per kilogram of carbon black,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; our production throughput would be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;5000 kilograms per hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;If this carbon black production unit produces &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;5000 kilograms per hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;, we can easily convert that to 5 tons per hour times 24 hours per day equals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;120 tons per day &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;times 365 days per year equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;43,800 tons per year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Every measurement has a degree of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;uncertainty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; associated with it. The uncertainty derives from the measuring device and the skill of the person doing the measuring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Accuracy and precision are two separate concepts. The classic illustration distinguishing the two is to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;consider a target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. Arrows surrounding a target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; indicate a high degree &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;of accuracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;; arrows very near to each other (possibly nowhere near the target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;) indicate a high degree of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;precision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. To be accurate, an arrow must be near the target center; to be precise successive arrows must be near each other. Consistently hitting the very center of the target indicates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;both accuracy and precision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Thermometers are notoriously inaccurate, often requiring &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;re-calibration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; several times over the lifetime of the instrument. Scales also require recalibration, especially if they are moved or mistreated.  Plant instrumentation needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; to be calibrated and tested to be sure they are both accurate and precise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;  Also, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;person doing the measurement must have a high degree of skill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; in the measurement process in order that the best measurement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; is made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;It is important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; in Industry that we are careful with our measurements so that they are both accurate and precise.  We use those measurements to make decisions about the business we are in.   Also, when we report data it is important that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;the data reflect the accuracy and precision of our measuring process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In today’s world, with computers and calculators, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;since numbers can be calculated and result in many decimal places, we may use all the available decimal places to report that number.  In the professional world that infers we have an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;accuracy and precision &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;in the number of those many decimal places.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;Did adding &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;more decimal points make it more accurate or more impressive?  Of course not.  The number should only be reported using the rules of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;“significant figures”.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The main guidance of those rules is that you should not report a number better than the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;accuracy and precision of the method used to measure that number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  In the illustration, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;ruler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; can measure the pencil accurately only to whole centimeters - six.  We can estimate one additional number 0.7 by estimating the distance between the six and seven.  As a result we enter the result 6.7 centimeters for the result – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span  fontWeight="bold"&gt;two significant figures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  If we continue to use this numerical measurement, we should always continue using it with the rules of significant figures to communicate the accuracy and precision of the original measurement – always two significant figures.  In this way, anyone using our numbers will be consistent in transferring the information in our organization and accurately reflect the precision and accuracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>
